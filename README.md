# CRUD using Angular, MongoDB, Express.JS</h1>

This project was part of a full stack job application challenge. The challenge was to create a RESTful API using MongoDB and Express. Additionally, I am using this project as an opportunity to practice Angular. The main goal is to build a todo list application that allows users to create, delete , update or just retrieve all tasks. üîç

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
# The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Angular
- Axios
- Cors
- Helmet (ExpressJS)
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- Node.js is installed. If not, download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:</li>

  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/BrunoSouza88/Job-challange_CRUD-With-MongoDB.git</code></pre>

  <li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>

  <pre><code>cd Job-challange_CRUD-With-MongoDB</code></pre>

  <li>Install the dependencies:</li>

  <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>

  <li>Start the server:</li>

  <pre><code>npm start</code></pre>

  <li>Access the application in your browser at <code>http://localhost:4200/</code> üåê.</li>
</ol>

The application provides a user-friendly interface to manage entities through the following operations:

- Create: Add new data to the database.
- Read: Retrieve and view existing data from the database.
- Update: Modify existing data in the database.
- Delete: Remove data from the database.

Use the web interface to interact with the application and perform the above operations easily.
